There's a time for everything.

After 5 years in Silicon Valley, I've moved back to Toronto, to be closer to family, and the general notion of 4 seasons.

I was born in the Italian Alps, so I do appreciate a good snowfall. Plus, one should not underestimate the power that Spring and Autumn can have on your psyche.

I absolutely loved my time in the Bay Area. Before my relocation to California, I wasn't actively looking for work, as I was already quite comfortable in the Financial Tech space, but the opportunity presented itself, so I took the plunge. Accepting the offer to work on challenging, complex problems, for a well-known, reputable company (LinkedIn), impacting millions of users, was a tough opportunity to refuse. Plus, I'll be bold and say that the compensation was great (as can typically be expected from those companies). My work-life balance was *acceptable*, and my wonderful spouse (a Chemical Engineer) easily found a job working for a global engineering firm (Fluor).

During my long motorcycle rides commuting to work I'd spend time thinking about what it would be like to work from home, on projects which satisfy my creative impulse. With my helmet visor as the sole barrier between my face and the scorching hot hair of the I-680, I'd imagine the benefits of freelancing.

Interestingly, opening up your helmet's visor in the summer heat of the I-680 stretch between Fremont and Dublin is akin to placing your face in front of a blow dryer. Not recommended.

I started investigating different places where I could enroll and start reaping the benefits of freelancing, however, I had found that most of the platforms out there were saturated with low-paying short-term projects that would most frequently be given to developers that would charge a fraction of what I would.

I've been a Software Engineer for over a decade, specializing in Web and Mobile applications, therefore, when it comes to experience, I think I have the necessary qualifications. Obviously, fair renumeration is of paramount importance to me, along with a steady stream of mid-to-long-term projects.

I'm a family man. Stability is imperative.

I've recently learned of [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com). What immediately interested me about Toptal is its [rigorous approach](https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent) to identify the best engineers. They typically only accept about 3% of applicants, instantly meaning that the pool of freelances in the system is that much more intimate than competitive platforms.

Because everyone at Toptal is a top senior developer (or designer), one can be sure that the the projects found therein are challenging, complex, and help stimulate creative passion. The caliber of talent leads to fair, competitive compensation.

I'm committed to joining to Toptal, as it invariably means satisfying all criteria in the freelancing realm: freedom, earning potential, security, and project satisfaction. If you're truly talented, and hope to reap all the benefits of freelancing, I believe Toptal would be a great place for you.
