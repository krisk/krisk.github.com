      <h2>A special message to The Obvious Corporation</h2>
      <sub>Pardon the novel, but I need more than 140 characters.</sub>

        Let me just go ahead and say that I love my current position, and employer.  Frankly, they really do not give me any reason to leave.  Nonetheless, I wouldn’t say that the technology I create helps people on a personal and social level (ex, twitter, blogger, or other collaborative web systems), though, it definitely does help them make money.  However, is that really the <strong>ONLY</strong> type of technology that I want to keep creating? Do my projects have to exist solely for the enjoyment of a very <strong>few</strong> privileged individuals? I’m not quite sure.

        However, in working with the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/biz">Nerd of the Year</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/goldman">failed astrophysicist</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ev">Evan</a> (no meat? Really? See my postscript below) I hope to create technology whose success is directly proportional to the positive impact it has, and, if I may kindly steal from your website, technology that makes people happy.  That’s probably my biggest motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        All right, I concede.  The technology should definitely be financially rewarding.

        P.S., I once spent a month in a monastery in Southern California.  It was during a fast.  The monks ate only vegetables.  I adapted for as long as I could, but had to escape the second week to the nearest town for a burger (or two).  Can’t really blame me - the monastery didn’t have tofu.

        P.P.S., If I join your team, I’ll try vegetarianism for a full month.
