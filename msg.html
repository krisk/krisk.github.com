        I like what I do.  You probably will like it too.  Let's join forces.

        Let me just go ahead and say that I love my current position, and employer.  Frankly, they really do not give me any reason to leave.  Nonetheless, I wouldn’t say that the technology I create helps people on a personal and social level (e.g., twitter, blogger, or other collaborative web systems), though, it definitely does help them make money.  However, is that really the <strong>ONLY</strong> type of technology that I want to keep creating? Do my projects have to exist solely for the enjoyment of a very <strong>few</strong> privileged individuals? I’m not quite sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in working with the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/biz">Nerd of the Year</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/goldman">failed astrophysicist</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ev">Evan</a>* (vegetarian? really?) I hope to create technology whose success is directly proportional to the positive impact it has, and, if I may kindly steal from your website, technology that makes people happy.  That’s probably my biggest motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        All right, I concede.  The technology should definitely be financially rewarding.

        My apologies, I know this is 12 times longer than what your average twitter user is accustomed to.  But if you've read this far, then thanks. Or, if you think this is too pathetically long, <a href="#" id="short_version_link">here's the short version.</a>

        * I once spent a month in a monastery in Southern California.  It was during a fast.  The monks ate only vegetables.  I adapted for as long as I could, but had to escape the second week to the nearest town for a burger (or two).  Can’t really blame me - the monastery didn’t have tofu.

        P.S. If I join your team, I’ll try vegetarianism for a full month. Scout's honor.
