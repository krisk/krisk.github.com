## Who am I?

Kiro Risk - a Web Developer.  Well, if you want to get pedantic, I'm a Senior Web Developer at [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kirollos "Kiro Risk - LinkedIn profile").

I work with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, Python, MySQL and a plethora of other programming goodness every day.
